## How to program the cosmos..
### ...one api at a time (first blog from my coding adventures at Flatiron School) 
> If you want to build a ship teach people to yearn for the vast and endless sea
--Antoine de Saint-Exupery 

### Some nature inspired curiosity

In our first day at [FlatironSchool](http://flatironschool.com) we were presented with this quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupery. The metaphor resonanted with me deeply as it crystalizes the way I approach every new project, challenge, learning and sharing opportunity. 

This quote also made me think of Goldfish growth versus tank size. The growth of the fish is conditioned by the size of his tank size because of increasing ammonia levels.

(ALERT: MYTH BUSTED) Goldfish don't grow only as large as their environment because their grow is determined by their genetic heritage however the size of their tank conditiones their growth indirectly due to the water quality. In other words the fish tanks have a [Garbage Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Limited_environments) challenge just like the city of New-York and many of the programming languages:) 

I take three major learnings from this nature instantiation of wisdom:
1.  beeing in an appropriate environment and changing the environment as we are evolving is key to our growth and development.
2. jumping to a larger bowl (as challenging as it may be at times) allows us to deal with our missconceptions waste and to constantly observe and assimilate new patterns.
3. people are very good at justifying their shortcommings (no Goldfish don't have a 3 seconds memory so you should really think twice before opting for that kitchen bowl). 

### From fishtanks to spaceships :rocket:
So Goldfish are cool (and they never stop growing) but let's go back to Antoine de Saint Exubery who wrote a book that touched me as a child (and continues to do so today).

What beter motivation than dreaming about space for challenging our limits of understanding and curiosity? 

A lot of my colleagues and our instructors have compared our learning curve to c a mountain climbing experience. For me it feels like going into space because I am learning how to get more and more perspective on things and climb the abstraction ladder.

As a first "lightstone" in this journey to infinity and beyond I would like to invite you to Cosmos, the Ruby program I crafted together with my colleague [Drew](https://twitter.com/drewfromspace).  

As we both love space we decided to play with the Nasa Api for Apod (Nasa picture of the day). Our constraint was to make everything run in the command line and we had two days to do it (with some mediation workshop and lectures along the way).

####This was our process:

1. Get the data from Nasa https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod
2. Convert the image in ASCI (Ascii art gem) https://rubygems.org/gems/asciiart
3. Build the CLI script 

###What we learned: 
- Run bash commands from ruby
- item
- item


run bash commands from ruby (
store api keys secretly 
use meta-programming to set our own instance variables 
call a private method with and argument and a proc (Proc.new {|n| n*factor })
make our terminal talk to us
http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_making_your_mac_talk_%E2%80%9Csay%E2%80%9D
search images by date
make a gif in the terminal
take pictures from the terminal https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap
build an array quickly with a large list of words and pick a random value
run things in the backend 
rspec mock open-uri?
deal with multiple keys and environment variables https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv
git workflow for new features and pair-programming 

###What we want to do next 
- publish code as a gem (probably ready by the time you read this:)
- improve tests (of course)
- add option to see original picture in the browser
- include 8bit music for background
- create option to stop backend processes(music background) without interrupting the program.
- add download option for picture audio playback
- make a podcast with all our random generated terminal voice-over-ascii-picture.

###The slingshot of it all..
